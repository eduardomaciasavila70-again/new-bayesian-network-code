# new-bayesian-network-code
algoritmo que describe uso de nuevo algoritmo para calcular propagacion de evidencia en redes bayesianas

In this Python program, the goal is to generate a Bayesian network and solve it using PyAgrum libraries. Afterwards, the instructions are coded using our own method in order to compare the results. The results from both methods should be the same since both are exact methods.
It is acknowledged that there are several possible sources of error:
Error in the mathematical formulation, which has been addressed by reviewing the mathematical proofs.
Error during coding, which can be fixed through extensive debugging.
Rounding errors.

This document is composed of several parts:
PART ONE: CREATION OF BAYESIAN NETWORK AND CALCULATION OF PROBABILITY VALUES USING STANDARD METHOD
PART TWO: CREATION OF BAYESIAN NETWORK WITH MERGED NODES
PART THREE: FOR VISUALIZATION ONLY
PART FOUR: SOLVING THE BAYESIAN NETWORK WITH MERGED NODES
PART FIVE SUBROUTINES FOR FINAL CALCULATION (NEW METHOD)
PART SIX CALCULATION (NEW METHOD)
PART SEVEN COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS
